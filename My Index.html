      <h2>La Rose Festival(August 30th)</h2>
      <p>In St. Lucia there are two flower festivals.</p>
      <p>The first one during the year is the La Rose(Lawoz) or the rose festival. This is a folk performance that belongs to a number of different theatrical traditions and social phenomena and is practiced in many villages and towns around the island. There is performance of things using masquing, dance, mime, play-acting and costume. The performance is like street theatre because on the grand day of the festival the performance takes place on the streets. Schools and churches elect people to act as king, queen, prince, princess, nurse, policeman, lawyer and many different positions in society. During the performances they parde and sing songs and chants which are choreographed and rehearsed days before the main event. The La Rose Festival was introduced into St. Lucia's culture from the period of slavery and to this day citizens whorship the rose and stands strong in the society</p>
      <p>Story of the La Rose Festival: The story goes that a girl named Rose worked in the great house on a plantation.  Her relatives and friends working in the fields and elsewhere on the property were quite badly treated often without enough to eat.  So Rose was in the habit of taking loaves of bread from the kitchen, hiding them in her apron, and taking them at night out to her relatives.  She was soon regarded with suspicion and watched.  One evening while she was carrying the bread out she was stopped by the guards and ordered to open her apron.  She had no choice but to comply; as she did so a miracle was created – instead of loaves, bunches of roses fell from her apron.  This saved her and was divine reward for her acts of resistance. She became Santa Rosa de Lima (Saint Rose of Lima), sanctified and celebrated by the folk in St Lucia.  A possible bridge between the island and the original setting of the story is the strong Roman Catholicism.  The island celebrants adopt both the sanctified girl’s name and the rose flower immortalised in the miracle, as their symbol.</p>

      <h2>La Marguerite(October 17th)</h2>
      <img src="Marguerite.jpg" alt="flower festival" id="pictures">
      <p>La Marguerite is the second flower festival celebrated in St. Lucian culture.</p>
      <p>The society of La Marguerite(Lamagrit) stand in opposition to La Rose. They hurl insults at each other and pretend to be enemies, they play-act a perennial feud, ridiculing each other in song. Citizen within society needs to decide which society they are part and serious about. Most times people just gravatate to the traditional flower festival which is already withing their families.</p>
      <p>However, just like the La Rose Festival their performance is of things using masquing, dance, mime, play-acting and costume. The performance is like street theatre because on the grand day of the festival the performance takes place on the streets. Schools and churches elect people to act as king, queen, prince, princess, nurse, policeman, lawyer and many different positions in society. During the performances they parde and sing songs and chants which are choreographed and rehearsed days before the main event.</p>
      <p>Additionally, The societies originated in the time of slavery as co-operative work groups created for mutual support, and assistance in time of trouble. In former years the St Lucian society was split in affiliation to one or the other group. At times membership has been illegal, and it has also been condemned by the Roman Catholic Church. Nevertheless, the societies survived, although their nature has changed through the centuries. Nowadays, the two historical societies are largely devoted to solidarity through recreation.</p>

      <h2>Wakes/Nine Nights(Year-Round)</h2>
      <p>Wakes occur throughtout the Caribbean all during the year. In St. Lucia  wakes occur after someone has pasteda and lasts for several days, with roots in religious tradition. During this time, friends and family come together to the home of the deceased. They share their condolences and memories while singing hymns and eating food together. However, the structure and occurances of a wake depends on the hosts religion and beliefs.</p>
      <p>Traditionally a typical wake would consists of specific foods and rum which the persons religion believed would send off the dead spirit properly. The wake night or nine nights would also consists of certain practices which is believed to depart the spirit. Additionally, after all the rituals are done the members at the wake partake in dancing and singing of hymns and many other instrumental folk music.</p>
      <p>However, throught the years the whole structure of wakes have changed. It still consist of music and dancing and sending off the spirit but as younger individuals get involved it is now more of a party and celbration than a ritual. Although, it still serves the same purpose and some communities do still experience the rich, cultural traditions during wakes.</p>
